once installed to run this command in shell : mongosh

show dbs: showing all the dbs

use college :college name db created 

it is temporary database once data is inserted it will set up permanently

to check current database: enter db in shell 

show collections it will be empty 

once data is insreted it will show collections  

college>  db.student.insertOne( {name: "shradha", city: Delhi, marks: 88 })

college> db.student.find()

db.student.insertOne( {name: "krishna", age: 19, marks: 88 })

college> db.student.find()


two ids are formed:

college>  db.student.insertMany([ { name: "catlyn", marks:64, city:"Delhi"}, {name:"Donald",marks:58, city:"mumbai"} ])
{
  acknowledged: true,
  insertedIds: {
    '0': ObjectId('67dd238b161fafaee2b71238'),
    '1': ObjectId('67dd238b161fafaee2b71239')
  }
}
college>  db.student.find()

in shell enter : college> db.student.find( {city:"Delhi"})

in shell enter : college> db.student.findOne( {city:"Delhi"})

db.student.find({ marks: { $gt: 50 } })

// deleting concept

‚úÖ Step 1: Delete a Single Document ‚Äî deleteOne()
Let‚Äôs say we want to delete the first krishna document (age 19).

db.student.deleteOne({name: "krishna", age: 19})
Result:
{ acknowledged: true, deletedCount: 1 }

‚úÖ Step 2: Delete All Matching Documents ‚Äî deleteMany()
Let‚Äôs say you want to delete all students named "krishna":

db.student.deleteMany({name: "krishna"})
Result:
{ acknowledged: true, deletedCount: 2 }  // if 2 krishna records exist

‚úÖ Step 3: Delete by ObjectId (Best Practice)
Each document has a unique _id. To delete a specific document:

db.student.deleteOne({_id: ObjectId("6835620c2db15731adb71236")})
Result:
{ acknowledged: true, deletedCount: 1 }

‚úÖ Step 4: Delete All Documents (‚ö†Ô∏è DANGEROUS)
If you want to delete everything in the collection:

db.student.deleteMany({})
‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful ‚Äî this will delete all students.

‚úÖ Step 5: Check Remaining Documents
After deletion, you can verify with:


db.student.find().pretty()
‚ùì Bonus Tip: Use find() before delete
Before deleting, it‚Äôs good to verify which records match your condition:

db.student.find({name: "krishna"})
